### Installation

1. **Clone the Repository**:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/Onafanewlevel/PDCPart2.git

## How to start the Game

    ant clean jar

    # MAVEN
    maven clean package

    # GRADLE
    gradle clean build
    ```
3. **Run .jar file**

    There is an issue if you run the command in the dist folder, i.e., **java -jar "PDCPart2.jar"** as the .jar file won't be able to read the custom font file.

    Therefore, just run this command in the **project home directory**.
    ```bash
    java -jar "dist/PDCPart2.jar"
    ```
